# Fact-Check

Made using Flask on VSCode, for the website the db is hosted on Supabase and server from Railway. As of now, there is only a homepage where different articles can be loaded (if there is more than one, I didn't procrastinate). Each article has popovers that can be seen by clicking highlighted text. The popovers discuss what may be misleading about a claim or whether data is true or not.

## Notes

There are two databases: one that holds the full text of the articles, and another that holds all the corrections for the articles connected by article id.
