0,Walz Is Wrong: President Trump’s Immigration Policies Are Saving Lives,"<p>
    What exactly does Tim Walz find so objectionable about enforcing our nation’s immigration laws? In his <mark id=""blue""><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""0"">pathetic, inflammatory<span class=""popover""></span></span></mark> press conference today, Walz <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""1"">bizarrely claimed <span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark><mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""2"">“there is no verifiable evidence” that President Donald J. Trump’s immigration enforcement operations are “making America safer.”<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark>
</p>
<p>
    <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""3"">Radical Left lunatics<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> like Walz, <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""4"">blinded by their deep delusions and seething hatred<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> for President Trump, have become completely <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""5"">untethered from reality<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> — ignoring the <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""6"">indisputable evidence<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> that President Trump’s immigration policies are <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""7"">literally saving lives<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark>:
</p>
<p>
    The nation likely saw the <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""8"">largest-ever<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> one-year drop in homicides in 2025 — with <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""9"">especially steep drops<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> in cities where the Trump Administration undertook targeted immigration enforcement and crime prevention operations.
</p>
<p>
    For example, a single immigration enforcement operation in Florida resulted in the arrest of <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""10"">150 illegal alien sex offenders<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark>, while operations in Chicago drove a <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""11"">dramatic decrease in violent crime<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark>.
</p>
<p>
    A <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""12"">staggering 70% of the 650,000+ illegal aliens<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> deported by the Trump Administration since taking office have been charged with or convicted of crimes.
    Deaths of on-duty law enforcement officers <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""13"">dropped by nearly 25%<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> in 2025.
    <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""14"">Traffic fatalities have dropped dramatically<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark>, with <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""15"">eased congestion in high-immigration cities<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> and the removal of <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""16"">more than 9,500 non-English-speaking commercial truck drivers<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> who posed <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""17"">safety risks on our roadways<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark>.
    Fentanyl trafficking across the southern border has been <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""18"">slashed in half<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark>, leading to <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""19"">lower fentanyl purity levels<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> and <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""20"">fewer overdose deaths<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> ravaging American families.
</p>
<p>
    Emergency rooms report <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""21"">significant reductions<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> in illegal immigrant visits, freeing up critical resources to better serve American citizens in need of urgent medical care.
</p>
<p>
    The share of Americans viewing crime as a <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""22"">“very” serious issue fell by nearly 15%<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> in 2025, reflecting the real-world impact of President Trump’s approach on everyday Americans’ lives.
</p>
<p>
    It is an indisputable fact that President Trump’s immigration policies are saving American citizens from being <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""23"">killed, raped, and assaulted<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> at the hands of <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""24"">criminal illegal aliens with no right to be here<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark>.
</p>
<p>
    If Walz and Democrats find that troublesome, it only further exposes their <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""25"">disturbing priorities<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark> — putting <mark><span class=""popover-trigger"" data-correction-index=""26"">criminals ahead of Americans<span class=""popover"">{% set i = i + 1 %}</span></span></mark>.
