        <p>Examining the percentage change shows that it has remained negative over the past several years, with a larger decline occurring between 2024 and 2025.

3,0,3,"<h3>Radical Left lunatics</h3><br>
             <p>This description relies on emotionally charged language rather than objective analysis. Terms such as ""Radical Left"" and ""lunatic"" are often used in political rhetoric to shape perception and can carry negative connotations (Oxford University Press, n.d.) that discredit the subject rather than explain their views.</p><br>
        <p>Governor Tim Walz's political positions are more accurately described as center-left by international standards and progressive-left within the U.S. context. As governor, he has supported policies such as expanded labor protections, universal school meals, gun safety measures, protections for abortion rights and LGBTQ+ individuals, and investments in clean energy (Vote Smart | Facts For All, 2024). These positions place him left of center in U.S. politics.</p><br>
        <p>Economically, Walz supports government involvement to reduce inequality, increased public spending on social services, and progressive taxation, aligning with social-democratic or progressive liberal approaches (Vote Smart | Facts For All, 2024). While he began his career as a more moderate Democrat, his positions have shifted left over time. He continues to work within existing democratic institutions, making descriptions of him as ""far-left"" or ""extreme"" more rhetorical than analytical.

        <p>Based on homicide data from the CDE, 2025 shows the largest year-to-year decline in homicides since at least 1985 (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2023). Although data for December 2025 is incomplete, the missing information is unlikely to significantly alter the overall trend.</p><br>

        <p>In the article, the word ""saw"" links to an Axios article that reports percentage changes between 2024 and 2025 and places the decline in a broader context.

9,0,9,"<h3>especially steep drops</h3><br>
        <p>The phrase implies a direct connection between enforcement actions and reductions in crime. While a correlation is suggested, additional evidence is needed to establish causation. Other factors, such as local government programs and long-term crime trends, could also contribute to these declines.</p><br>

        <p>The word ""undertook"" links to a Heritage Foundation article highlighting crime reductions in Washington, D.C., but the article does not provide the full context. Data from 2023-2024 shows an even larger percentage decrease in overall violent crime and every sub-category save for burglary, suggesting that the trend was already downward before these enforcement actions (District Crime Data at a Glance | Mpdc, 2026). Additionally, data for December 2025 is incomplete, so the full-year impact is not fully captured.</p><br>

        <p>The word ""cities"" links to an ABC News article reporting mid-November 2025 figures, noting large percentage drops in specific crimes such as homicides, robberies, and carjackings (Minock, 2025). When the full-year data is examined, the decreases are smaller and closely match trends from previous years. For example, homicides decreased by 32% in 2025, similar to a 31% decrease in 2024. Robberies were down 37% in 2025, which is similar to 39% in 2024. Carjackings showed a similar pattern with being down 50% in 2025 and 48% in 2024 (Carjacking | Mpdc, n.d.; DC Crime Data and Stats - Robbery, 2024; U.S. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 2024). These figures indicate that the observed reductions may not be solely attributable to federal immigration enforcement.</p>

        <p>The phrase ""steep drop"" links to another ABC article noting the largest year-to-year decline since 1985 (Hutchinson, 2025). While 2025 does show a significant drop in homicides based on CDE data, the overall downward trend across multiple years suggests that these declines are part of an ongoing pattern rather than the result of a single policy (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2023). In addition, the data from areas like Chicago and D.C. have maintained a downwards trend without exhibiting a 'steep drop' (Chicago, n.d.; District Crime Data at a Glance | Mpdc, 2026).</p>

        <p>The figure of 650,000+ was linked to the statement by Secretary Kristi Noem. I struggled finding statistical data supporting the statement, for comparison, The Guardian's ICE tracker reports a total of 352,380 deportations, which is lower than the 650,000 figure often cited (Craft & Witherspoon, 2025; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 2025). However, public records show that ICE informed Congress in summer 2024 of a list of 650,000 immigrants with criminal histories whom they planned to locate. The most common offenses included traffic violations (such as drunk driving), immigration violations (such as illegal reentry), and assault (Miroff, 2025). Other sources note that some deported individuals had criminal histories, but nearly 73% of deportations involved people without a criminal conviction (Bier, 2025).</p><br>

        <p>The word ""crimes"" was linked to a DHS article that highlighted some immigrants captured by ICE with a criminal history; however, it fails to mention other American citizens accidentally arrested as well (Department of Homeland Security, 2025; Sprecher, 2025).</p><br>
        
        <p>Overall, the statistic may exaggerate the impact of deportations on public safety and should be interpreted in the context of broader ICE enforcement data and definitions of crime.</p><br>

        <p>The linked article primarily focuses on Los Angeles, which experienced a 1% decrease in traffic delays from 2024 to 2025 (Castleman, 2025). However, it does not include data from other major cities, some of which saw increases during the same period. For example, Chicago and Philadelphia recorded increases in delays of 12% and 31%, respectively (INRIX, 2022). Official data also show increases in cities such as Dallas (7%), Washington, D.C. (13%), and Boston (5%) (INRIX, 2022). Among the cities listed early in the rankings (organized by impact rank), only Los Angeles (-1%) and North Charleston, South Carolina (-3%) showed decreases (INRIX, 2022).</p><br>
        <p>Larger percentage changes appear in smaller cities, with some locations like Greenville (NC), Rochester (NY), and Tallahasee (FL) experiencing increases of up to 100%, while others saw significant declines (INRIX, 2022). For example, Butte, Montana recorded a 67% decrease in delays (INRIX, 2022).

        <p>Claims about “safety risks on our roadways” should be considered in light of broader traffic safety data. According to a study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the largest share of traffic fatalities is consistently associated with drivers and passenger vehicle occupants (NHTSA, 2025). Fatalities involving pedalcyclists and large trucks remain among the smallest categories in both 2024 and 2025, which may partly reflect the lower number of cyclists and commercial trucks compared to passenger vehicles.</p><br>

        <p>Additionally, national data show that traffic fatalities have been declining for 13 consecutive quarters (Staff, 2025). This ongoing downward trend suggests that changes in roadway safety are influenced by multiple factors over time. As a result, attributing safety improvements primarily to the removal of specific groups or enforcement actions is not clearly supported by the available evidence.</p><br>

        <p>Available data indicate that overdose deaths have declined, but this trend cannot be clearly attributed to border enforcement alone (Gallagher, 2025). The article cited in support of the claim notes that part of the reduction is associated with expanded access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), which are intended to reduce overdose risk (Gallagher, 2025).</p><br>

        <p>The Washington Post reports that final overdose death figures for 2025 have not yet been published (as of January 10, 2026) and should be reviewed once complete data become available (Ovalle & Cadell, 2026). Other reporting attributes some of the reduction in fentanyl availability to actions taken by China, including a multiagency crackdown following a 2023 meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping (Ovalle & Cadell, 2026). Notably, overdose deaths had already begun to decline before that agreement was reached.</p><br>

        <p>In addition, some states and local governments have expanded the distribution of overdose prevention medications to the public, which may also contribute to lower fatality rates. Taken together, these factors suggest that the decline in overdose deaths is influenced by multiple interventions, making it difficult to link the trend directly to border enforcement efforts alone.</p><br>

        <p>Some reports, including a Federalist article, note that certain hospitals in LA observed a reduction in emergency room visits and missed appointments among individuals identified as undocumented immigrants following increased immigration enforcement (Thies, 2025). However, these observations are localized and may reflect changes in behavior due to fear of enforcement rather than overall health trends. The data do not provide a nationwide picture, do not clearly define how immigration status was verified, and do not quantify the effect in a way that allows independent verification.</p><br>
        <p>Emergency room usage is influenced by many factors, including access to primary care, public health programs, and socioeconomic conditions.

22,0,22,"<h3>""very"" serious issue fell by nearly 15%</h3><br>
        <p>The statement that the share of Americans viewing crime as a ""very"" serious issue fell by nearly 15% in 2025 is potentially misleading (Rego, 2025). Public perception of crime does not directly measure actual crime rates, and attributing changes in perception to a single policy is speculative. In addition, focusing only on the category ""'very' serious"" selectively highlights part of the data while overlooking broader context.</p><br>
        <p>Gallup survey data show that perceptions of crime severity have shifted over multiple years. From 2024 to 2025, the percentage of Americans who believed there was more crime in the U.S. declined by approximately 15% (Brenan, 2025). However, the share of respondents who described crime as extremely or very serious dropped 2 years in a row (2024 with 11.11% decrease and 2025 with 12.5% decrease) (Brenan, 2024; Brenan, 2025).</p><br>
        <p>In 2025, 17% of adults described crime as ""extremely"" serious and 32% as ""very"" serious, compared with 25% and 31% in 2024 (Brenan, 2024; Brenan, 2025). This indicates that overall concern about crime shifted in nuanced ways rather than declining uniformly. As a result, claims that frame these perception changes as clear evidence of policy success oversimplify the data. This interpretation appears to stem from a mischaracterization of Gallup polling reported by The Hill, rather than from the underlying survey results themselves. (There was a 15% overall decrease, but specifying the word ""very"" is where the dissonance arises) (Rego, 2025).</p><br>

23,0,23,"<h3>killed, raped, and assaulted</h3><br>
        <p>The phrase uses dramatic language that implies a direct causal link between immigration enforcement and reductions in violent crime. Such wording goes beyond what can be supported by available evidence because it attributes specific outcomes (e.g., prevention of homicide, sexual assault, or other violence) directly to immigration policy. To establish causality, one would need rigorous, peer-reviewed data showing that these policies independently and significantly reduced violent crime rates, after controlling for other factors such as local policing strategies, economic conditions, demographic changes, and broader crime trends.</p><br>

        <p>While there is evidence showing that some deported individuals had criminal convictions (DHS, 2025), and while some jurisdictions have reported declines in certain types of crime, these associations do not, on their own, demonstrate that immigration enforcement was the direct or primary cause of reductions in homicides, sexual assaults, or other violent offenses among American citizens. Statements that frame enforcement as definitively ""saving lives"" therefore overstate what the data currently show and should be supported by specific, transparent evidence linking policy actions to measured outcomes.</p><br>
